## Introduction

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for the Password Generator application. Following these guidelines ensures code quality, maintainability, and security across the project.

## Code Structure

### Package Organization
- Organize classes into logical packages based on functionality
- Follow the standard Java package naming convention: `com.organization.project.feature`
- Keep related classes in the same package

### Class Design
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Limit class size to 500-1000 lines maximum
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Make classes final unless designed for extension
- Minimize class dependencies (aim for high cohesion, low coupling)

### Method Design
- Methods should do one thing and do it well
- Limit method length to 30-50 lines maximum
- Limit parameter count to 4 or fewer
- Return early to avoid deep nesting
- Avoid side effects in methods

### Code Layout
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use blank lines to separate logical blocks
- Group related methods together
- Place fields at the top of the class
- Order methods by visibility (public → protected → package-private → private)

## Naming Conventions

### General Rules
- Use meaningful, descriptive names
- Avoid abbreviations except for common ones (e.g., `id`, `url`)
- Be consistent with naming patterns

### Specific Conventions
- **Classes**: PascalCase, noun phrases (e.g., `PasswordGenerator`, `SecurityValidator`)
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase, adjectives or nouns (e.g., `Generatable`, `PasswordService`)
- **Methods**: camelCase, verb phrases (e.g., `generatePassword()`, `validateStrength()`)
- **Variables**: camelCase, noun phrases (e.g., `userPassword`, `strengthScore`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH`, `DEFAULT_CHARSET`)
- **Packages**: all lowercase, no underscores (e.g., `generator`, `validation`)
- **Boolean variables/methods**: Use "is", "has", "can" prefixes (e.g., `isValid`, `hasSpecialChars`)

## Comments and Documentation

### Code Comments
- Write comments for complex logic only
- Explain "why", not "what" (the code shows what it does)
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use TODO comments for temporary solutions or planned improvements

### JavaDoc
- Follow the project's [Java Documentation Guidelines](JavaDocumentationGuidelines.md)
- Document all public APIs
- Include examples for non-obvious usage

## Error Handling

### Exception Handling
- Use specific exceptions rather than generic ones
- Don't catch exceptions you can't handle properly
- Don't swallow exceptions (catch and do nothing)
- Log exceptions with appropriate context
- Clean up resources in finally blocks or use try-with-resources

### Input Validation
- Validate all user input before processing
- Provide clear error messages
- Fail fast - validate inputs at the beginning of methods

## Testing

### Unit Testing
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Use descriptive test method names: `shouldXWhenY`
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- One assertion concept per test method
- Mock external dependencies

### Test Organization
- Mirror the package structure of the main code
- Group related tests in test classes
- Use appropriate test categories/tags

## Security Practices

### Password Handling
- Never store passwords in plain text
- Use strong cryptographic algorithms for password operations
- Avoid hardcoded secrets in source code
- Follow OWASP guidelines for password security

### Input/Output Security
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate input against expected patterns
- Be cautious with displaying sensitive information

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Coding
- Prefer StringBuilder for string concatenation in loops
- Use appropriate data structures for the task
- Minimize object creation in performance-critical sections
- Avoid premature optimization

### Resource Management
- Close resources properly (files, connections)
- Use try-with-resources for AutoCloseable resources
- Be mindful of memory usage with large collections

## Version Control

### Commit Practices
- Make small, focused commits
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format: `type(scope): message`
  - Example: `feat(generator): add special character support`
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable

### Branching Strategy
- Use feature branches for new development
- Use pull/merge requests for code integration
- Keep the main branch stable and deployable
- Delete branches after merging

## Code Reviews

### Review Process
- All code changes must be reviewed before merging
- Use pull/merge requests for code reviews
- Address all review comments before merging

### Review Checklist
- Code meets the standards in this document
- Tests are included and pass
- Documentation is updated
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- No performance regressions

## Tools and Automation

### Recommended Tools
- **Static Analysis**: Use tools like SonarQube, PMD, or SpotBugs
- **Style Checking**: Configure Checkstyle according to these standards
- **IDE Configuration**: Share IDE formatting settings in the repository
- **Build Automation**: Use Maven for consistent builds

### CI/CD Integration
- Run automated tests on every pull request
- Include static analysis in the CI pipeline
- Enforce code coverage thresholds
- Automate documentation generation
## Security Practices

### Password Handling
- Never store passwords in plain text
- Use strong cryptographic algorithms for password operations
- Use **bcrypt** (`org.mindrot:jbcrypt`) for password hashing and encryption with appropriate work factors
- Avoid hardcoded secrets in source code
- Follow OWASP guidelines for password security
